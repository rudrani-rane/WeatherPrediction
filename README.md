Research Paper: Localized Weather Prediction: Incorporating Terrain and Geographical Factors for Improved Accuracy 

Accurate weather prediction in localized regions is challenging due to microclimate variability and limited data. This research proposes a stacked ensemble model combining Support Vector Regression (SVR) and XGBoost to improve air temperature predictions at a fine scale. Using high-resolution sensor data, we preprocess the dataset and conduct exploratory analysis to capture essential feature relationships. Optimized SVR and XGBoost models are combined with a linear regression meta-learner to leverage both linear and non-linear data patterns. The ensemble achieves superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for localized forecasting applications.
